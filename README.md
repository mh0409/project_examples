## Contents

### trp.red
* Collected comment and submission (post) data for r/TRP using Pushshift.io API to complement qualitative analysis; research ongoing under Turing Institute supervision
* Performed data validation (time-series checks to ensure full date coverage)

### Wikipedia Comment Classifiers: Obscene or toxic?
*  Pre-processed text data to train, cross-validate, and test one classifier each for obscene and toxic Wikipedia comments using logistic regression (glmnet)
* F1 score of 90%, meaning that models predicted accurately 90% of the time when tested on new data
* Programmed in R

### Facebook Sentiment Analysis: Why is there so much negativity? 
* Created and queried SQLite databases from Facebook posts, comments, and reactions to understand why there is so much negativity on FB comments about politics after cleaning data from US legislators’ FB pages
* Scraped legislator biographical information to augment analysis and conduct hypothesis tests, finding that negativity in political comments tends to garner more attention and response than neutral or positive comments regardless of legislator party, age, or gender (RSelenium, rvest)
* Programmed in R

### PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds: Do cheaters' victims cheat?
* Created network simulations in Python based on PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds match data
* Tested hypothesis that being killed by a cheater makes someone more likely to cheat, with statistically significant findings rejecting the hypothesis. This suggests that cheating is likely not best described as a contagion phenomenon
* Programmed in Python
